N: Number of LRU sets
R: LRU order (R slots to a set)

Naive LRU:

	Space: N * Rlg(R)
	N sets, each with R slots, each requiring lg(R) bits.

	Time: R/P, 1 < = P <= R
	R slots requiring an update, of which P can be performed in parallel.

LRUMAP:

	Space: R! * Rlg(R!) + N * lg(R!)
	Fixed cost of R! permutations, each with R possible moves, each
	encoding a destination in lg(R!). Variable cost of N sets, each
	encoding a current state in lg(R!).

	Time: 1
	1 state being updated.
