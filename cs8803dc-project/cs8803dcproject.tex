\begin{abstract}
Intel processors since the 65nm Conroe Core\texttrademark2
have included hardware to queue decoded loops directly into the out-of-order
execution engines\footnote{For an excellent comparison of the Loop Stream
Detector to the Pentium 4's trace cache, see \cite{kanter}.}. These ``Loop
Stream Detectors'' (LSD) allow for substantial power savings and, in some
cases, performance improvements. Unfortunately, the LSD can only store
instruction streams meeting a number of architecture-specific restrictions.
The Loop Stream Decoder represents an unmistakable power optimization, can be
definitively verified via the Core\texttrademark i7's LSD\_UOPS performance
counter, and has clearly-defined requirements for successful use. All these
properties make optimizing for the LSD an attractive prospect, especially for
a runtime translator. Daytripper consists of a DynamoRIO \cite{dynamorio} client
module capable of discovering loops which fail to engage the LSD, analyzing
them for valid transformations, and attempting to reschedule their bodies to
take full advantage of this hardware.

\section{Introduction}
The x86's CISC legacy, unique among modern processors, requires substantial
instruction decoding hardware and several pipeline stages. Recent Intel processors
provide no less than four instruction decoders, along with an MSROM. Of these,
only one (``complex'') decoder can handle instructions decoding to multiple
$\mu$ops; for very long instructions (those decoding to six or more $\mu$ops),
this complex decoder must engage the slow Masked-Or ROM unit and its
microcode store. This hardware's power requirements, not to mention the havoc
wrought on hot loops by front-end stalls, led to the introduction (on Crusoe
Core\texttrademark 2 processors) of the original Loop Stream Detector.

\begin{figure}

\label{fig:lsdcorei7}
\end{figure}

Benefits of the original LSD included \cite{inteloptimize}:
\squishlist
\item The documented ability to shut down instruction fetch and branch prediction hardware.
\item The possibility of shutting down instruction cache \textit{in partes} or
\textit{in toto}, as explored in other processor designs \cite{badulescu} (no
such capability has been mentioned in Intel documentation).
\item Elimination of delays due to misaligned branch targets.
\item Recovery of execution bandwidth used by branch instructions.
\squishend

The Loop Stream Detector was improved for the release of the ``Nehalem''
Core\texttrademark i7. Moved after the decoding stages, it now supplies $\mu$ops directly
to execution units (as opposed to instructions to the decoder).

\caption{The Core\texttrademark  i7 Loop Stream Detector}
\label{fig:lsdcorei7}
\end{figure}

Benefits include:
\squishlist
\item The entire processor frontend can be powered down during LSD streaming,
as opposed to merely the instruction fetching hardware.
\item Length-Changing Prefix stalls, major sources of delays in the frontend,
are eliminated.
\item Stalls due to contention for the single complex instruction decoder are
avoided, as are the extreme delays due to MSROM-based decoding.
\squishend

The Loop Stream Decoder is a microarchitectural property: it operates wholly
without programmer intervention, and is not visible in the x86 ISA. The LSD
will cache any instruction/$\mu$op stream that has looped (branched backwards)
64 times, and meets the following conditions:
\squishlist
\item It requires no more than 4 instruction fetches of 16 aligned
bytes each.
\item It contains no more than 4 branches, none of them a CALL or RET.
\item It contains no more than 18 instructions (on Core\texttrademark 2).
\item It contains no more than 28 $\mu$ops (on Core\texttrademark i7).
\squishend

\section{Optimizing for the LSD}
Optimizing for the LSD requires the abilities to recognize hot loops, determine
whether or not a given loop is suitable for the LSD, and transform unsuitable
loops into suitable forms. This last must be performed while honoring the
original program's semantics, and (obviously) in a fashion guaranteed to
terminate. Daytripper leverages the DynamoRIO binary translation framework
for disassembly and encoding of instruction streams, and its \textit{trace}
objects (as opposed to \textit{blocks}) provides suitable recognition of hot
loops.

Determining whether or not a loop qualifies for the LSD can be a difficult task
in and of itself. The requirements of the Core\texttrademark 2's LSD are simple
enough for a static compiler to consider, but the Core\texttrademark i7's LSD
complicates matters by caching $\mu$ops rather than instructions. Intel does
not (at this time) make public the correspondence of instructions to $\mu$ops\footnote{Agner Fog's venerable datasheets \cite{agnerfog} do publish an approximate correspondence, but these follow processor releases, at best, by several months.}. These 
mappings change from processor to processor or even stepping to stepping, and
are further mudded by microarchitectural techniques such as Micro- and Macro-fusion
of $\mu$ops. Any compiler must already have some idea of $\mu$op mappings
if it is to fully optimize for decoder resources, but simply knowing which
instructions decode to multiple $\mu$ops is sufficient to make full use of
Pentium-M, NetBurst, Core and Nehalem microarchitectures' ``3-1-1'' or ``4-1-1-1''
decoder arrangements.

Thankfully, a performance monitoring counter (LSD\_UOPS, event 0xA8) was
introduced alongside the improved LSD. While a static compiler (especially in
the absence of profile-guided optimization) would be hard-pressed to
effectively make use of this PMC as a litmus (especially as runtime code
placement decisions can affect suitability), a dynamic compiler is well-suited
to begin its search with the counter. Daytripper simply resets the counter on
entrance to a DynamoRIO trace entry callback, and checks it during the trace
exit. If the counter has changed, the LSD has been employed, and daytripper
needn't perform further work. Likewise, a zero count suggests analysis of the
associated trace.

The performance counter also serves to gauge our effectiveness. Daytripper
marks any trace it modifies. Since it never transforms a trace which triggered
the LSD, any marked trace with a non-zero LSD count represents a successful
transformation. Other marked traces represent wasted work, and are indicative
of bugs in Daytripper's suitability testing. Given this instant and highly
accurate feedback, any errors in $\mu$op mapping ought be flushed out quickly.
Daytripper is thus fairly resilient against microarchitectural changes\footnote{The
author spent significant time planning integrating such a scheme into GCC's PGO, thinking
it the coolest part of this project.}, or at least automatically discovers any
which affect its effectiveness. Furthermore, this allows binaries to be
sorted based on whether they can effectively be transformed (subject, of course,
to the same vagaries which complicate static PGO). Daytripper translation can
thus be foregone when it will have no effect.

Verifying other properties is a fairly simple (if distinctly unpleasant) task.
This merely requires knowledge of branch instructions (at the ISA level) and
their LSD limits, location of the code at runtime, disallowed instructions,
and properties of the instruction fetch unit. These last are microarchitectural
properties, but thankfully not a maintenance burden: the CPUID instruction
allows all relevant properties (page size, instruction cache size, and
associativity)\footnote{Whether the instruction and data caches are unified is irrelevant;
we're verifying not residency, but boundary crossings.} to be discovered
at runtime.

\section{Related work}
Virtually every reference to the Loop Stream Detector, from GCC bug reports
\cite{gcclsd} to various optimization guides, speaks of supposed performance benefits.

This is wrongheaded.

While it is true that streaming instructions (in the case of Conroe) or $\mu$ops
(in the case of Nehalem) from the Loop Stream Detector bypasses several pipeline stages,
this does not, by itself, represent a gain in throughput. At a saturated steady
state, CPI is independent of pipeline length. The LSD applies only to tight
loops---precisely the sections most easily benefited by branch prediction,
large data caches, advanced prefetching and extensive speculation. In short,
it targets code for which Intel has already spent a decade adding hardware
support (as noted earlier, the LSD \textit{can} remedy certain decoding
perversions specific to the x86 architecture).

The LSD would be highly relevant to research on optimizing for power, were it
not for the facts that:
\squishlist
\item It is present only on energy-hungry high-end x86 processors, poor fits for
systems designed to conserve power.
\item It is only so effective at reducing power consumption due to the large
transistor budget required for high-speed x86 instruction decoding; a classic
RISC processor could not reap nearly such significant benefits.
\squishend
Whether or not the Loop Stream Detector will emerge as the focus of academic
research is thus debatable. This paper appears to be the first investigation
of dynamic translation for the explicit purpose of engaging the LSD.
